First 3 variables are a, b and c are initialized with the values 1, 2 and 0 respectively. Since the sum of the even fibonacci numbers is required which must be less than 4 million, first while loop is used to where the condition is such that the value of b remains below 4 million. Then, if decision statement is used where the condition is such the modulus of b divided by 2  has to b 0 which will denote that only even numbers are gained. Then, the variable c is used to store the sum of previous value of c and b. Finally, within the loop the value of b goes on increasing with the new values and the sum of the fibonacci series is gradually stored in c. After the loop completes, the value of c is printed to obtain the sum of even fibonacci series below 4,000,000.
